fig2 - fig2
fig3 - fig5

the fig3 in this paper was part of a parameter sweep, something that will be needed for a longer version of the paper.

fig1 is similar to fig2, just for shorter runs, it turns out the
cooperation method grows longer than expected.

fig4 was just some messing around and can be ignored.

graph.jl is for graphing the very long CAs
fraction.jl works out how rare a fitness score is

agentExamples.jls, which is on zenodo, is a collection of CAs, in the
form of a dictionary form CA number to fitness, these are just CAs
that happened to occur during various experiments, in the future I
will do this again sampling from the CA number and with a long
potential time alive horizon.

longest.txt is a collection of some long CAs that were created by the
various runs, it isn't any sort of sampling, I changed to potential
time alive horizon a few times and, also, often when I had seen a long
CA I adjusted the threshold for saving long CAs accordingly.
